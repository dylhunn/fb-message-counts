# Facebook Message Count tool
This javascript utility generates message counts for your Facebook conversations, and indicates how many messages were sent by each participant.

# How to use
Go to your Facebook settings and download a copy of your Facebook data. Then, add the script to the html directory in the downloaded archive, and add the following to the end of `messages.htm`:

`<script src="messageanalytics.js"></script>`

Then, load messages.htm in your browser. Wait a few minutes for the page to finish loading.
